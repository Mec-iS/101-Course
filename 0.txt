##Welcome!

We are here to let you folks get in touch with Google App Engine (since now GAE), a developer-friendly environment to design and realize apps powered by Google hosting/computing services, Big Table database, and other Google goodies.

The GAE's presentation as Google Cloud service [here](https://developers.google.com/appengine/). All the docs are accessible from the left-side menu.

As you can see, you can develop with GAE by two stable developing environment: Java and Python. And two experimental one: PHP, Go. This doc will focus on Python developing, as the author thinks it's the most enjoyable of the four.

To know a little more about Python you can read this really great articles:

* [Why Python Is More Fun Than Java](http://brizzled.clapper.org/blog/2008/07/28/why-is-python-more-fun-than-java/)

* [Why Python Is The Best](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/why-python-best)

I just find Python to be more productive and fit for solo developing, easy to find docs and examples, and really tuned to OpenSource community. A lot of free books can be found on the Internet, to learn to be a better Python programmer. It is also proved that Python is the most [newbie-friendly programming language](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3088/best-ways-to-teach-a-beginner-to-program)... probably (:
